  Online shopping has become widespread all over the world. These e-commerce sites, which peaked with the Covid-19 pandemic, are in great demand. From now on, these shopping methods will have a great place in our lives. People can buy lots of things on the internet now.This technology isn't use only for clothes or effects.People can buy anything they want from a E-sommerce website. In China people are using blockchain for supplying food[1].
E-commerce sites that sell fake product for deceiving people increased after online shopping is became so popular. These sites, which reach people especially through social media, sell products that are very close to original ones. People who do not understand the difference between these products become victims of these sites. In order to prevent this, a project idea was proposed to solve this problem.
The production time, place and manufacturer information of the products produced using blockchain technology are stored. Afterwards, the production phase is completed, the distribution and sale phases are also recorded. The information of the owners of the sold product is also regularly recorded on the Blockchain. In this way, the originality of the products will be checked and the people selling fake products will be exposed.

# METHOLOGY

  In the pandemic I saw a huge demand on online shopping. Everyone started to use onlise shopping methods during the pandemic. While market was growing, hackers and frauds started to see an opportunity on the internet. Most of the people don't know anything about online shopping so they started to sell fake products to people. I decided to build a program that uses online verification about products. First I started to write smart contracts with solidity. First part of the project is about creating products,retail and customer details. When manufacturers produced a new product, they are saving the product's information to the blockchain. Retailers are also creating an information about themselves because when manufacturers send the products to retailer they are becoming first owner of the products. Customer can log and create their profile on the blockchain and they can view their products by using their hash email address. They can also view other products if someone is selling them.
